 Who We Are

The Special Foundation is a social impact organisation that focuses on raising young African
leaders through education by providing platforms and opportunities to fulfil their dreams. We
are a community of young professionals with a vision to improve the quality of leadership in
all spheres of governance in Africa by creating access for more children to get an education.
Founded by Seyi Akinwale in 2018 through his vision to improve the quality of leadership in
all spheres of governance in Africa and ensure the creation of a platform where more young
people can maximize their potential by gaining access to education. The foundation has
empowered over 21,000 less privileged, gifted African Children through education,
mentorship, and leadership opportunities.

Our Mission
To improve the quality of leadership in Africa by providing a platform where less privileged
and highly talented children can be equipped with an education, mentoring and leadership
training to bring about a positive influence to their world.

Our Vision
“Making dreams come true”
We dream of an Africa where more young people have access to an education and the
essential tools that provide them with a foundation to be positive change agents to their
respective communities, the African continent and the World.

How We Work
Our strategy is anchored on three pillars which are Quality, Life Long Development and
Access. Currently, we are scaling our impact across Nigeria and Africa by targeting to raise
100,000 leaders by 2030. Our strategy directly resonates with Sustainable Development
Goal 4 on Education though our work spans across a wide spectrum of the SDGs global
development framework.

Improving Quality Education
The Special Foundation leverages partnerships to improve the quality of education for all
students in Nigeria. Through our partnership with schools, we extend our reach to
disadvantaged communities and lower the costs of quality education to the most vulnerable.

Lifelong Development
Our lifelong development programme provides educational and psycho-social support to
facilitate the continuous personal and professional development of our beneficiaries. The
programme includes leadership training and mentorship through internships, community
involvement and lifelong engagement through our volunteer network equipping young people
with the leadership and life skills needed to become champions in their families,
communities, and schools.

Access to Education
We provide access to education through two targeted scholarship programmes, the Inspire
Scholarship & the Special Scholarship. The Inspire scholarship is targeted at children in
primary and secondary schools while The Special scholarship is targeted at talented & gifted
students in local tertiary institutions.

Our Work
The Inspire Scholarship
The Inspire Scholarship Program is designed to provide scholarships for children of low
income earners, orphaned children, and families that have lost a breadwinner. This initiative
focuses on primary and secondary school students. The scholarship funds are paid directly
to the schools to cover the following items for each child per session:
• Tuition • Uniform costs • Books • Stationery • Lunch

Who qualifies for the scholarship?
● The applicants must be orphaned (lost one or both parents) and or a disadvantaged
child with both parents who are unable to fend for the child.
● All applicants must be less than 18years.
● Scholarships are restricted to day and boarding Government, Private or mission
schools in Africa.
● The Scholarship will not sponsor children outside of their country of residence at this
time. The scholarship is valid until the student completes their secondary education.

Special Summer School
This program is designed to offer out-of-school and less privileged children continued and
all-around capacity development. It runs for about 3-5 weeks, during the summer holidays.
The age range of participants is from 8 to 18 years. At the end of the program, the
participants are equipped with various skill sets such as mental mathematics, creative
writing, ICT, public speaking, and craftsmanship.

Mentorship/Career Day Program
Our Mentorship/Career Day program is a program where professionals in different fields talk
to school students about their careers. The Professionals bring the realities of the jobs to the
children together with life skills, secrets on how to make career choices, tips on how to excel,
personal success stories and career opportunities.
